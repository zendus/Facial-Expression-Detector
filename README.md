# Facial-Expression-Detector
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to build a real-time facial expression detector using Keras and OpenCV. The system can identify facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., and overlays corresponding emoji equivalents on the detected faces in real-time.
